<h1>WILDLIFE SANCTUARY</h1>
<h3><em>If we will save our wild places, we will ultimately save ourselves.</em></h3>
<hr>
<p>Most of those who visited the area were serious birders, and the place was a protected wildlife sanctuary.
While the tigers in India's wildlife sanctuaries are thriving, those roaming elsewhere are competing for space with dams, roads, tourist complexes, industry, and even villagers scrounging for firewood or grazing ground.Any area other than area comprised with any reserve forest or the territorial waters can be notified by the State Government to constitute as a sanctuary if such area is of adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural. or zoological significance, for the purpose of protecting, propagating or developing wildlife or its environment.</p>
